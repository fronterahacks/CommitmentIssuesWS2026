# Commitment Issues? Git & GitHub Workshop

Welcome to the official repository for the **Commitment Issues? Git & GitHub Workshop** 

In this workshop, you will learn the fundamentals of Git and GitHub by contributing to a live project and seeing your changes trigger real-time sounds and visuals.

---

## What We’re Building

A tool that transforms GitHub activity into sounds and visuals so you can literally **hear and see commits happen in real time.**

When you successfully push your changes, music will play — meaning you just contributed to a real repository!

---

## What You’ll Learn

- How Git tracks your work with a clean, rewindable history
- How developers collaborate without overwriting each other’s code
- The basic Git workflow used in real engineering teams
- How repository events can be interpreted into creative outputs

---

## Why Git?

Git helps developers keep a reliable history of their work so progress is never lost. It also enables multiple people to work on the same project smoothly without interfering with one another.

If you plan to work in tech, **Git is not optional — it is essential.**

---

## Core Git Commands

You will use these commands during the workshop:

```bash
git clone      # Copy the repository to your machine
git add        # Stage your changes
git commit -m "message"   # Save your changes locally
git push       # Upload your changes to GitHub
```

---

## Workshop Activity

Your task is simple:

**Clone this repository and add your name to the attendance sheet.**

If everything is done correctly, a song will start playing

## Recommended Workflow

Follow this order to avoid issues:

1. Clone the repo
2. Make your changes
3. Add your files
4. Commit with a message
5. Push to GitHub

---

## Pro Tips

- Always pull the latest changes before pushing
- Write clear commit messages
- If something breaks — don’t panic. It happens to every developer.
